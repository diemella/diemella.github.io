    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Hi, and welcome! My name is Diem, and one of my favorite past time is crocheting. I find it relaxing and rewarding when I am working on a project. I call myself an amateur, thus I'm not here to teach you how to crochet. The purpose to convince you to give it a try and provide you with some helpful resources through your journey.</p>
    <p>The best way to learn is to just start. I learned by watching YouTube videos. Simply search what you want to crochet; however, I recommend starting with the common stitches listed in the table below. Once you get a hang of them, search for the crochet projects you want to do. I started with hats, and I am currently into <em>Amigurumi</em> projects. Check out my gallery for some inspo!</p>
    <p>To get started, you will only need a few items.</p>
