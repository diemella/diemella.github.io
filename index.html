    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Hi, and welcome! My name is Diem, and one of my favorite past time is crocheting. I find it relaxing and rewarding when I am working on a project. I call myself an amateur, thus I'm not here to teach you how to crochet. The purpose to convince you to give it a try and provide you with some helpful resources through your journey.</p>
    <p>The best way to learn is to just start. I learned by watching YouTube videos. Simply search what you want to crochet; however, I recommend starting with the common stitches listed in the table below. Once you get a hang of them, search for the crochet projects you want to do. I started with hats, and I am currently into <em>Amigurumi</em> projects. Check out my gallery for some inspo!</p>

        <li>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HappyBerryCrochet">link</a> to one of my favorite Crochet channel, where I learn most of my awesome crochet skills.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/free-crochet/patterns">Ralvery</a> is a great site for patterns.</li>
        <li>This <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/basic-stitches-in-crochet-978516">post</a> on The Spruce will guide you through some basic stiches. Although this site is overloaded with ads making it hard to identify the content, the fonts and pictures makes it appealing to the eyes. The font family and size along different colors make it less boring.</li>
